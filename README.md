# Code Refactor - Module 1 Challenge

## Description

- The motivation and the reason of building this project was to understand the underlying basics of HTML and CSS. This project showcases a website with its own navigation page, main section, and side section. Throughout the process of this project, I was able to learn more about refactoring and the importance of cleaning up code as a developer. 


## Installation

- Not applicable.

## Usage

- When traversing this website, the user should be met first with a navigation list at the very top. The user can use this navigation menu to jump to different main sections of the page (Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing). Within these sections, their are images and descriptions detailing those corresponding sections/topics. To the side of the main sections, there are also more topics disussing the benefits of the company that the website is designed for (Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, Cost Management).

- The user may also open the DevTools/Console (Control+Shift+I) to further find alt text/descriptive text for the images within the website.
